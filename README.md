##Planning
I am going to create a mario-style game where the player jumps up to avoid obstructions in their path.

##building
I have built the basic mechanics of the game. When the player hits the obstruction, the game ends. Now I am going to add the score. Next I am going add CSS to the game to make it feel more fun.

#debugging
I created a new function to track the score, however it wasn't working so I added the score functionality to jumpFunction instead
