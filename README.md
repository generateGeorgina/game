##Planning
I am choosing a racing game as I feel it is going to be challenging to program and fun to play. The racing object will begin moving forwards from the start line. There will be other objects along the path which if the racing object bumps into it, the game will be over. To complete the game the racing object must cross the finish line. The number and placement of objects will be random. The journey length will remain constant. The player is able to move the racing object side-to-side using the forward and backwards keys on the keyboard.
